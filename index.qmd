# About Me! <span style="color: grey;">(About Us)</span>

---!!! Front row tip: If you want to see something serious, you can completely skip this section of "self-introduction" overflowing with adolescent vibes and go directly to the content below! Believe me, reading it will only make you feel embarrassed! ---

I'm kqlqkqlqF, and this website showcases the projects I've completed in the past as well as my hobbies and interests... No!!! Of course, I won't write such boring text on my personal website! Let's start over with the introduction! <span style="color: grey;">(Nice to see this side of you... so bold)</span>

:) Hello there! I'm Yiyi Feng, but you might know me better by my online alias "kqlq". You can imagine me as a quirky and multifaceted creative enthusiast, best known for opening a mind feast that's uniquely my own at any time and any place... To put it bluntly, it's just a mess of thoughts :( <span style="color: grey;">(From a higher emotional intelligence standpoint, perhaps it's just flights of fancy?)</span>

Currently, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Genetics and Statistics at the University of Toronto. My curriculum? Oh, just your usual mix of statistics, cell and molecular biology courses. No big deal, right?

Although I have a passion for everything I don't understand, I'm clearly not your typical science nerd. Sure, I can analyze data like a pro or extract DNA in the lab, but I've also worked part-time as a bartender in a cyber bar. Yes, you heard that right—I'm a time management master of mixing drinks and coding! <span style="color: grey;">(Please, a little humility...)</span>

When I'm not buried in experiments in the lab or coding in RStudio, you'll probably see me interacting with my unbridled creativity. From designing original characters on Procreate to creating secondary animation on AE, I hope to present my ideas in the best possible way! <span style="color: grey;">(That's a fair assessment, very much your style)</span>

But wait, there's more! I'm also a self-taught economist! <span style="color: grey;">(You're blowing your own trumpet a bit too much)</span>, a budding chef in the making! <span style="color: grey;">(Ask me what culinary masterpieces I've made recently)</span>, and a beginner learning Japanese! <span style="color: grey;">(Why does Japanese grammar have so many uses for one word?)</span> Oh, am I perhaps a bit too fond of boasting about myself?! <span style="color: grey;">(Indeed, it's becoming a bit hard to read)</span> Well, at least I think I'm kind of a big deal. <span style="color: grey;">(If you're not arguing with yourself like a split personality, indeed.)</span>

In a nutshell, I'm just an ordinary university student with a strong desire to explore the unknown and always ready to take positive action. So, fasten your seatbelts and embark on this adventure called life with me—it's bound to be an exciting journey! 


# Videos I <span style="color: grey;">(We)</span> Made

I <span style="color: grey;">(We)</span> regularly post new videos on the Bilibili video platform. Unless there are special circumstances, we aim to update with at least one video every two weeks. Additionally, resources related to the video, such as images and text, will be reformatted and uploaded to other platforms, such as Xiaohongshu and Lofter. The videos I <span style="color: grey;">(we)</span> make are primarily derivative works related to anime and manga, including short animations and memes. Original character and world-building videos are also in production, but due to their limited audience appeal compared to derivative works, I <span style="color: grey;">(we)</span> plan to increase the release of original character-related videos once we<span style="color: grey;">(us)</span> have a larger fanbase.

Some of these drawings are original characters created by me<span style="color: grey;">(us)</span>, while others are derivative works. Some are created for videos, while others are just illustrations, but all of them were completed within the past year. As my drawing skills still have a lot of room for improvement, I<span style="color: grey;">(we)</span> continue to explore and learn new drawing styles.
